What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?

HTML semantic tags are placeholders that indicate what kind of code is contained between them. I find the nav one the most useful, because it organizes the webpages for the user in an easy and straightforward fashion.


What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?

The browser goes from top to bottom of the HTML code.


What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?

I didn't know that you could create your own snippets in Sublime! I will definitely continue to create more snippets to make my coding faster.



What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?

The concept that was the most difficult for me was learning about the different kinds of semantic tags. I get them mixed up with each other and it's hard to remember what each one does. I think I just need to keep working with HTML more because I' a hands-on learner. I pick things up more quickly when I'm actually doing them.
